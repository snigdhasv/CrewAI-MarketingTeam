## ⚠️ Limitations & Considerations

- **Instagram Analytics**: Due to Instagram API restrictions, deep engagement metrics and competitor analytics are limited. The system relies on public data and third-party APIs (e.g., Serper for web search). For advanced analytics, integration with paid third-party services or manual data input may be required.
- **No Direct Instagram Posting**: The system generates content and strategy but does not post directly to Instagram.
- **Web Scraping**: Not used by default due to legal and ethical considerations. If deeper analytics are needed, consider integrating with compliant third-party analytics APIs.
- **LLM Provider**: By default, the system is configured for Gemini. To use OpenAI or another provider, update the `.env` and configuration files accordingly.
- **Content Quality**: While the AI provides high-quality suggestions, human review is recommended before publishing.
- **Third-Party API Costs**: Some analytics or search features may require paid API keys for full functionality.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with data privacy laws and platform terms when integrating third-party services.
